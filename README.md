# User_Management_API
This API provides basic functionality for creating, updating, and deleting users. User authentication and authorization are implemented using Json Web Token and user roles. The stack used includes MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. This is my first significant API project, and I welcome feedback from the community to enhance its quality.
